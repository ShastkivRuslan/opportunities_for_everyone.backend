# Opportunities Platform - Back-end API
## Short Description
The Opportunities Platform is a comprehensive system for managing assistance projects, volunteers, and partners with a complete set of administrative and public APIs. Built on Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.3.4, this platform provides secure management of donations, news, documents, and users through a role-based authentication system. The system uses MySQL for data storage, includes Telegram integration, supports project management, and provides robust endpoints for both administrative and public usage, all documented with OpenAPI and secured with JWT authentication.

1. **SUPER_ADMIN**: Has complete access to all administrative functions
2. **ADMIN**: Has access to most administrative functions except the most sensitive ones
3. **EDITOR**: Has limited administrative access focused on content management

All administrative endpoints require authentication and proper authorization based on the user's role.
